# Cloning your first repo, tinkering with python, and navigating Markdown in Jupyter Notebook

For this assignment, you are going to:

1. write a very simple python program from the command line; and
2. learn how to work with Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks
3. submit your first assignment in GitHub Classroom

## Writing a simply python program from the command line

We can write a program in python using the vim editor.

Open a file with vim for editing:

'vim hello-world.py'

push `i` to enter 'insert' mode

Add the following text:

> \# This program asks the user for their name and interest and prints the result to screen
> user_name = input("What is your name?")
> user_interest = input("What are you interested in?")
>
> print("My name is " + user_name + ", and I like " + user_interest + ".")

You can exit the 'insert' mode by pushing the 'ESC' button. Now 'write' and 'quit' 'vim'. Push 'ESC', then ':', then 'wq' and 'ENTER/RETURN'. This should bring you back to the command line.

You can run your program with the command 'python hello-world.py'.
